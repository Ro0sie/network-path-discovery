# Network Path Discovery (Stack-Based DFS)

This project implements a stack-based DFS traversal to determine whether a path exists from a given starting position to a goal cell ('G') inside a 2D grid network.

## Features
1. Custom Stack ADT  
2. Iterative DFS (non-recursive)  
3. Cycle avoidance via marking visited cells  
4. Step labeling to track traversal order  
5. Boundary and dead-end handling  
6. Pytest test suite for correctness  

This project is based on UCSB CS9 — Programming with Python
